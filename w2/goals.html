        <h2>Academic Goals</h2>
        <p>
            I've recently decided to come back to school to earn a certificate and Associate's Degree in <strong>Web Development.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope to learn new things, add more skills to my belt, and face challenges that will have me feel like Rocky Balboa at the top of the stairs when I overcome them.
        </p>

            <em>
                I'm aiming to accomplish these goals by Fall 2024 - Spring 2025
            </em>

        <h2>Personal Goals</h2>
        <p>
            There are several goals I have set up for myself that I hope to accomplish.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Earn my certificate in Web Development by Summer or Fall of 2024.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create an LLC so I can start developing on YT/Streaming services by <del>Thanksgiving or Christmas this year</del> Spring next year.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once I earn my certificate, begin teaching bootcamp courses virtually (possibly in person too).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Even though I've taught front-end Web Development and worked as a Software Developer/Full-Stack Developer in the past, I feel I would be taken more seriously if I have the credentials to go with my experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Other Far Far Away Goals</h3>
        <ul>

                Create polished and advanced courses to sell
            </li>
