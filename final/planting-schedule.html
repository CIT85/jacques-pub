                    Timing is everything in gardening.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our schedule is crafted to align with nature's rhythm. In spring, as the soil warms up, it's ideal for planting vegetables like tomatoes and peppers, and flowers like roses and tulips.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Summer is our reward season, with gardens bursting in colors and flavors. Autumn is the time to plant hardy winter crops and to prepare the beds for next year's growth.
